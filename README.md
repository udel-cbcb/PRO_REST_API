# Protein Ontology RESTful API

This repository is for Protein Ontology RESTful API powered by its SPARQL endpoint.
## Protein Ontology Linked Open Data

Protein Ontology Linked Open Data exposes, shares, and connects pieces of data, information, and knowledge about protein-related entities on the Semantic Web using URIs and RDF. It provides an alternative way to access the Protein Ontology for querying and integrating with other Linked open datasets. Protein Ontology Linked Open Data is served by an OpenLink Virtuoso Universal Server. Data can be browsed via Faceted Browser interface. Data can be queried using SPARQL. RDF data dumps are also available for download. We provide metadata description for PRO Linked Open Data, which is compliant with the W3C HCLS specification.
